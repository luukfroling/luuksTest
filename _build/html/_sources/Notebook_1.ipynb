There are also code cell  (containing your code), like the cell below it. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programmers often forget things, and often they forget what variables they have defined. Also, computer programmers always like to save typing if they can. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the people who made Jupyter notebooks included a handy feature called \"TAB completion\" (which is actually something that has been around for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion>a long time</a> in unix and ms-dos command line environments). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that if you start typing part of the name of a variable or part of the name of a function, and then push the `TAB` key, Jupyter will bring up a list of the variable and function names that match what you have started to type. If only one matches, it will automatically type the rest for you. If multiple things match, it will offer you a list: you can either keep typing until it's unique and press TAB again, or you can use the cursor keys to select the one you want.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here is an example: \n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "this_is_a\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "Handy! Jupyter did the typing for me! \n",

    "this_is\n",

    "## Understanding Python Errors<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section_1_6\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the code you type into a code cell will not work. In this case, Python will not execute your code, but instead print out an error message. In this section, we will take a look at these error messages and learn how to understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write some code that will give an error. For example, this is a typo in the name of the `print()` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "printt(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After your code cell, you will see some colored text called a \"Traceback\". This \"Traceback\" is the way that Python tries to tell you where the error is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the traceback:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"Figures/Python/Notebook_1_anatomy_of_an_error.png\" width=60%></img></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback contains three important details that can help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The type of error\n",
    "2. Where the error occurred in your code\n",
    "3. An attempt to explain why the error happened\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1 and 2, Python is pretty good and will communicate clearly. For 3, sometimes you need to have some experience to understand what python is trying to tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, the type was a `NameError` that occured on line 2 of our code cell. \n",
    "*(By the way, in the View menu, you can turn on and off line numbers in your cells.)* \n",
    "\n",
    "A `NameError` means that Python tried to find a function or variable that you have used, but failed to find one. If you look already at the line of code, you can probably spot the problem already.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very end of the traceback, Python tries to explain what the problem was: in this case, it is telling you that there is no function named `printt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also get a `NameError` if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(non_existant_variable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common type of error is a `SyntaxError`, which means you have typed something that Python does not understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = a $ 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get errors if you try to use operators that do not work with the data type you have. For example, if you try to \"divide\" two strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"You cannot \" / \"divide strings\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you get a `TypeError`: the division operator is a perfectly fine syntax, it just does not work with strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, errors are also called \"Exceptions\", and a complete list of all error (exception) types, and what they mean, can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#concrete-exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you can learn more about what the error means by reading these documents, although they are perhaps a bit hard to understand for beginners. \n",
    "\n",
    "In last resort, you can also always try a internet search: googling the error message can help, and there are also lots of useful posts on <a href=https://stackexchange.com>stack exchange</a> (which you will also often find by google).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Exercise 1.14`** \\\n",
